## Range Safety Officer (Air Rifle) course

### Purpose 
Online training course for certification of CIC Officers to operate an air rifle range for Cadets - safely and within standard procedures.

### Distribution
English and French, for National access via the Defence Learning Network.  Expected official duration of 6 hours, including quiz and other activities.

### Roles/Responsibility
I designed and developed the course content with the Content Development Officer (CDO) and a subject matter expert from concept to implementation. I expanded the existing templates to include new layouts for more interactivity, simple gasification and clear navigation.

### Approach
I developed with Trivantis Publisher v11, and published as SCORM modules for delivery on Saba LMS.  Exported to HTML for Portfolio review.  
This course contains the following attributes:
- controlled navigation aspects
- table of contents “on-demand pop-up”
- formative quiz
- summative test (multiple attempts are permitted)
- in-course certificate

### Instructions for review
